This directory contains the images used in your CV template.

## Getting Images

### Profile Photo
- Use a professional photographer
- Ensure good lighting and clear background
- Dress professionally
- Face should be clearly visible
- Image should be recent and represent you well

### University Logo
- Download from your institution's official website

## File Naming

The template expects these specific filenames:
- `profile_photo.jpg` (or `.png`)
- `university_logo.png` (or `.jpg`)

If you use different filenames, update them in your `config.tex` file:

```latex
\newcommand{\photopath}{assets/your_photo_name.jpg}
\newcommand{\universitylogo}{assets/your_logo_name.png}
```

## Image Quality Tips

1. **Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (300 DPI) for print quality
2. **Compression**: Balance file size with quality
3. **Format**: PNG for logos (transparency), JPG for photos
4. **Testing**: Compile your CV to check how images appear
5. **Backup**: Keep original high-resolution versions

## Privacy Note

These image files are included in version control by default. If you want to keep them private:

1. Uncomment the relevant lines in `.gitignore`
2. Use placeholder images in the repository
3. Keep your personal images in a separate, private location
